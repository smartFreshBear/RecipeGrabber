# RecipeGrabber
An API that doing the following - given a url that points to webside with a recipe, filttering all the "blah blah blah"  before and after the recipe (ingredients and instructions) and returing only them.

the target of the project is for me to take all what I have learned from Coursera first 2 ML courses and teach a computer to recgonize the ingredients and instructions.

phase 1: 
1- use some modified version of all the neural network method that I was implementing while doing the courses.
2- prepare a preprocessing flow that gake examples and vectorizing them.

phase 2: 
use real API(TensorFlow, SK,KERAS) to replace the written functionallity

phase 3: travel the world in 7 seas - everybody is looking for something


cloning & running(via pycharm)

0-learn git and clone the project to your local machine, here is a nice video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE. </br>
0.1read about & install anaconda. </br>
1- download pycharm. </br>
2-clone project from gitHub("get from vcs or something similiar): </br>
https://github.com/smartFreshBear/RecipeGrabber.git. </br>
3-read about pip and its relation to python. </br>
4-go over all the .py files and use pip [u can use the pycharm terminal] to install all the missing dependencies]. </br>
5- try to run the flask app[also read about flask!]. </br>


TODO -  </br>
[] create a requirements.txt for our python project </br>
