# RecipeGrabber
An API that doing the following - given a url that points to webside with a recipe, filttering all the "blah blah blah"  before and after the recipe (ingredients and instructions) and returing only them.

the target of the project is for me to take all what I have learned from Coursera first 2 ML courses and teach a computer to recgonize the ingredients and instructions.

phase 1: 
1- use some modified version of all the neural network method that I was implementing while doing the courses.
2- prepare a preprocessing flow that gake examples and vectorizing them.

phase 2: 
use real API(TensorFlow, SK,KERAS) to replace the written functionallity

phase 3: travel the world in 7 seas - everybody is looking for something
